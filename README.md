# Create your own Vision Chat Assistant on AWS EC2 with LLaVA 1.5 and Runhouse

A tutorial by the [Runhouse](https://github.com/run-house) team to help you get started with multimodal conversational models using the open-source LLaVA-1.5 model and the open-source Runhouse library.

For more information please reference our [blog post](https://www.run.house/blog/create-a-visual-chatbot-on-aws-ec2-with-llava-1-5)

**Update** - Llava was recently released in Hugging Face Transformers, lending to much simpler code. You can find an example in `llava_chat_transformers.py`.
